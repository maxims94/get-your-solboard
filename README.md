# Get Your SolBoard!

![Screenshots](/img/2023-02-12_screenshots.png)

**This is an online shop for skateboards that runs on Solana and has a built-in loyalty programme.**

For each item ("SolBoard") you buy, you get an NFT of that item.

If you buy a pricy item, you additionally receive a coupon. It can be redeemed on your next purchase to get a discount.

Each coupon is stored as NFT in your wallet. At every purchase, you can choose which one (if any) to use.

This is my contribution to the [Encode x Solana hackathon](https://www.encode.club/encode-solana-hackathon)hackathon.

### Remarks

Running into issues? You can also watch this [demo](loom.com).

**Please be patient.** Devnet can be sluggish sometimes. It usually works if you try again, though.

**Your wallet is topped up automatically.** You should alway have enough funds to buy more items.

If you run into a "Transaction expired" error, that's most likely because you're on mainnet! In this case, please switch to devnet.
